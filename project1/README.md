## Introduction

Puzzle games are some of the oldest games around, can be played by anyone regardless of players' age, experience or the time period. It can be used to determine a player's skill, provide a change in pace when done together with other activities, or simply to enjoy and pass the time.

Bejeweled was chosen to make use and test my programming skills that I have picked up from the last 2 weeks. It would be appropriate for my skill level, but would provide a challenge at the same time. The game also has the potential to be customized, so there are definitely ways to refresh or reintroduce it to a new audience.

Since this is also quite a old game, I could also test and compare the logic I've coded with others to see if we have a similar approach or if I have missed something out.

## How to play:

- Match 3 or more tiles of the same color together in a row or a column.
- The same color tiles will be erased from the board, new tiles will replenished and fill up the empty gaps in the board.
- The game ends when there are no more available valid moves.

## Tools used:

Used: Javascript, CSS, HTML

## What could be improved:

- Add sounds: background music, combo/chain sounds, etc.
- Implement a larger board size, and increase number of different color tiles according to the difficulty.
- Add a scoreboard, or add a time limit to make the game more challenging.
- Added features that would distinguish my game apart from the others, for example adding special tiles with different effects, like the special tiles in Candy Crush.
- Being able to change the tiles to a different icons such as animals, shells or vehicles would be a nice touch.
